**Office Hours**: By appointment, in-person meetings or video conferences 

## Course description 

The aim of of this course is to introduce students to a variety of tools, mostly centered around R, to handle computational and data presentation tasks that we commonly encounter in biology. The aim of this seminar is develop an approach to handling data and analyses in efficient ways that can easily be shared with others in your field.

## Pre-Requisites
* A personal laptop computer that you bring to all lecture and lab meetings
    - Mac or Windows, with battery power to last 2.5 hours
    - all [required software packages](CourseMaterials/SoftwareInstallation.html) installed and working
    - wireless access and an active TU mail account
* Graduate standing as a PhD or MS student at TU
* Undergraduates by invitation only after consultation with the instructor
* Knowledge of basic statistics (p-values, means, variances, hypothesis testing)

## Course Learning Outcomes
At the conclusion of this seminar students will::

1. Understand how to use freely available tools to make their research analyses and communication more efficient and attractive.  
2. Establish repeatable workflows for data and computationally intensive analyses.
3. Consider design principles and advantages and limitations different types of data visualization.
4. Develop skills in critical reading of primary literature and the effective presentation of primary research.  


## Readings (recommended)

[Wickham and Grolemund, R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

[Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)

## Seminar Structure

We will meet for one long session each week. For the first half of the semester, I will start each session with an introduction and walk through of a tool with the group. I expect you to follow along and run the processes/code on your own computer. Once this introduction is complete the remainder of the session will be available to complete homework assignments and work on class projects. The second half of the semester will be student led and in each session two members of the class will present their lessons/projects to the group. 

## Assignments

**Participation** Attendance is expected at our weekly meetings and I expect you to follow along with the class presentation running processes/code on your own computer.

**Homework** There will be short assignments to give you practice using these tools introduced in the seminar. You will "turn in" assignments by posting them in in html format to your public repository and website on GitHub.

**Lesson** Each student will develop a lesson and teach the class about an R package or specifc data visualization that they have or will apply to their own research. This will include an introductory lecture/walk through, a homework exercise for the class, and a brief presentation using the tools to analyze and interpret their own data (or publically avialable data).  

### Grading 

Item |   | Total points  
:------------  | :-------------  | :------------
Participation  | -  | 100   
Homework  | 10 x 10 points  | 100   
Lesson  | 1 x 100 points  | 100  
 **Grand total**  | -  | **300**

The grading scale will be as follows:  89.50-100% - A, 79.50-89.49% - B, 69.50-79.49% - C, 59.50-69.49% - D, < 59.50% - F. No exceptions. 

## Class Schedule
